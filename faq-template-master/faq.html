				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
		
            BITS-Pilani is not only at par with the IIT's but better in many areas. There are many reasons but i find these valid to mention here:</br>

<b># No compulsory attendance</b> like in most IITs failing which you get debarred from giving exams. Here, you may not attend a single class but it's the sincerity in students which makes them work hard and not "Rules and Regulations." </br></br>

<b># The academic flexibility (The option of a dual degree) </b>You can pursue both science and engineering together here. Students can take admission based on their BITSAT score in any of the campuses into an Msc. degree-Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Economics and Maths. These are students who have an aptitude for science and wish to pursue careers in the research field. There are many combinations one as CS and Maths; or EEE/ENI/Mech and Physics/Economics etc. So at the end of five years you have a B.E. as well as an Msc. degree. </br></br>

# Most importantly You get admission here purely on merit basis.Even when the nation was boiling with the implementation of reservation policy on caste lines by Arjun Singh, BITS had taken a bold stand and opposed it stating that merit can not be compromised under any circumstances. </br></br>

To sum up The IIT brand as it stands today is much greater than any engineering college but if you want to develop management,leadership qualities in yourself, BITS is the best place in INDIA.</br></br>

P.S. Right from the day a student enters the campus all decisions are taken by him or her. Students get to make their own time table, they get to choose the teachers they want to study under , the time when they wish to study, the courses(electives) they wish to choose.

				<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>Why should I join the 5-year dual degree programme? In the 4-year programme, I finish one year early.</span></a>
				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Generally BE takes four years to complete and dual takes five years. Dual degree that are offered at BITS campuses are Msc.(Hons) Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Mathematics and Physics. First year will be common to all. Depending upon the CGPA of first year and your preferences, all the dualites will be allotted their respective BE degrees. </br></br>

From second year to fourth year BE students will start following their BE degree. In second year Msc students will start reading their Msc degree. In third year dualites start pursuing BE degree with their juniors along with Msc. In fourth year they will follow BE only. In fifth year they will either do thesis or PS or both. To sumup in simple terms dualites will study BE with their juniors.</br></br>
ADVANTAGES:</br></br>
1. If you think its difficult to get your desired branch in BE through BITSAT then you can opt for dual, work hard in first year, get a reasonable CGPA and opt for your desired branch.</br></br>
2. Msc can be advantage to your BE degree in placements. For example Msc Economics + CS is a crazy combination. You can be preferred more than normal BE people. </br></br>
3. You will get an extra year to enjoy the campus. Believe me this will be a boon which you will realize after third year. </br></br>
DISADVANTAGES:</br></br>
1. You will have to study an year more.</br></br>
2. You have to pay more.</br></br>
3. A bit of extra burden in third and fourth year.</br></br>

Overall its not bad to opt for dual. I am also a dualite. I feel its better to take dual if you really want to pursue your favorite branch but couldn't get it.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>BITS Pilani fee is higher than the fee at IITs or NITs. Why?</span></a>
				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Fee in BITS Pilani is high compared to the other Engineering colleges.</br></br>
<ul>

<li>BITS Pilani does not get funding from government unlike IIT/NIT get from government.</li>
<li>BITS didn't agree to implement caste based reservation system in exchange for getting funds from Government.</li>
<li>Quality education ( Reputation, Exposure etc ) is not easily available in India.</li>
<li>Hiring & maintaining top professors ( most of them have done Phd), that too in place like Pilani.
Also BITS Pilani is focusing on long term growth. Hence the fee’s are higher compared to other engineering colleges.</li>

Is it worth it ?</br></br>

I feel that despite the fees , studying at BITS Pilani is definitely worth of it. It provides solid foundation for next stage of your life. It may be hard for middle class students. Try to score good CGPA and get Merit-cum-need scholarship.</br></br>

Trust me, if you can do well, you will definitely get in to good company and this fee will become tiny compared to the career ahead.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>Is branch change allowed?</span></a>
				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Branch change requires quite a high CGPA of 9.8+ or even 10! Even if you get that CGPA(university topper), your branch change depends upon number of vacant seats in your branch of choice! If during admission process, all the seats are filled(it rarely happens these days that a seat is left vacant) then you might not get transferred to the branch of your choice! Hence it is very very difficult, which makes it non-advisable to enter BITS with a branch in which you dont have interest hoping you will easily change branch, almost never gonna happen!</p>
